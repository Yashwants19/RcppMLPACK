mlpack is a fast, flexible machine learning library, written in C++, that
aims to provide fast, extensible implementations of cutting-edge machine
learning algorithms. mlpack provides these algorithms as simple command-line
programs, C++ classes and bindings for : Python, Julia, Go and R which can
then be integrated into larger-scale machine learning solutions.
